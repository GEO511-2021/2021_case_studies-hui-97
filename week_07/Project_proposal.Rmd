# Introduction to problem/question

Jakobshavn Isbrae, one of the largest tidewater glaciers in Greenland, has been exhibiting complex spatiotemporal behaviors. After ~20 years of acceleration, retreating, and thinning, it started to decelerate, readvance, and thicken beginning in 2016. The acceleration and retreat resumed in 2019. Understanding the driving mechanisms of these changes, especially the reversal in 2016, is essential to predict its future contribution to sea-level rise under different scenarios of climate change.

Previous studies found that decreased submarine melt and extended existence of rigid melange as a result of ocean cooling near the terminus are strong candidates for causing the reversal. However, the roles of the subglacial drainage system and bed topography remain elusive. This project aims to compare the relationships of ice surface velocity with the subglacial drainage system, bedrock topography, and oceanic temperature to identify the forcing driving the evolution of Jakobshavn Isbrae.

# Problem / Question

What are the driving the variations of ice flow of Jakobshavn Isbrae on Western Greenland?

# Inspiring Examples

## Example 1

This figure illustrates the first few steps I want to do in this project. It shows a map of the surface ice velocity of Jakobshavn Isbrae with its location on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Time series of surface ice velocity are extracted at different locations from a bunch of such maps. The lower panel shows the decomposed seasonal and interannual trends. It helps analyze the velocity data at different temporal scales and locations on the glacier.

## Example 2

Modeled and observed terminus evolution of Jakobshavn Isbrae until 2018 and bedrock elevation map. Previous studies found a correlation between terminus position and ice velocity in this glacier. Bed elevation can be used to calculate the bed slope and depth of the terminus or grounding line to compare with variations of terminus position and velocity.

## Example 3

Seasonal correlation patterns for 1958–2007 of the Ilulissat meteorological station recorded surface air temperature observations vs Polar MM5–modeled 2-m air temperature. I will produce similar correlation maps showing correlations between different pairs of variables, for example, ocean temperature vs surface ice velocity.
